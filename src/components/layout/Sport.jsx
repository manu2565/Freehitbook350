              Cricket is a game played on a field with a ball and a wicket. The
              objective of the game is to score runs by hitting the ball in such
              a way that it goes into the in-goal area. The most common types of
              cricket are first-className cricket, List A cricket, and Twenty20
              cricket. First-className cricket is the highest level of competition
              and is played between teams from different regions. List A cricket
              is played between teams from the same region and is considered a
              lower-level competition. Twenty20 cricket is played between teams
              from different countries and is considered a higher-level
              competition.

              For cricket, the batsman holds the bat with both hands, while the
              wicketkeeper holds the ball with one hand and bats with the other
              hand. The batsman swings the bat from side to side to hit the
              ball, while the wicketkeeper bats with one hand and catches the
              ball with the other hand. The goal of the game is to score as many
              runs as possible by hitting the ball into the in-goal area.
